# CatchBART
An iOS app written in swift to find the nearest BART station and display that station's schedule

## App Store
CatchBART is currently awaiting approval from Apple's App store, but when it's ready I'll be sure to update this readme with a link

## Developers
To explore the code for this app, just fork the repo and/or download a copy. Use Xcode 7+ to open CatchBART.xcodeproj. If you want faster access to the BART API, be sure to follow the directions in API.example.swift to use your personal API key.

## Credits
The original idea for this app came from Steven Law's www.gettothetrain.com [https://www.gettothetrain.com/#/bart]

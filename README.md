# CatchBART
An iOS app written in swift to find the nearest BART station and display that station's schedule

## App Store
CatchBART is currently awaiting approval from Apple's App store, but when it's ready I'll be sure to update this readme with a link

## Developers
To explore the code for this app, just fork the repo and/or download a copy. Use Xcode 7+ to open CatchBART.xcodeproj. If you want faster access to the BART API, be sure to follow the directions in API.example.swift to use your personal API key.

## Credits
- The original idea for this app came from [Steven Law's](https://github.com/s-law/) www.gettothetrain.com. My efforts to build this app naitively for iPhone are entirely due to how useful I've found Steven's site (which can be saved to your homescreen so it acts just like a mobile app)
- I used Fan Zhao's [iOS Swift Weather Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-LZs0De7_U) to help me understand http requests in swift.
- I got excellent styling feedback from [Ian Deboisblanc](https://github.com/iandeboisblanc) and Amber Fearon
